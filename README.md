# Hi, I'm @xilinqie

I am currently a undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University. I also took a minor in Finance at Fudan University. My current research focus is on graph neural networks and large models.

The programming languages that I am most familiar with are Python, C++ and Swift.
